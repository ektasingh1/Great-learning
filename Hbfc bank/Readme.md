#Personal loan data analysis – (EDA) 

## Description
“Finding out potential target customers for personal loans” 
HBFC Bank has a growing customer base.  
Majority of these customers having deposits and Term Deposit in the bank.  
The number of customers having loan accounts is quite small, and the bank is interested in 
expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more 
through the interest on loans.  
The management wants to explore ways of converting its customers having deposits to 
personal loan customers. 
At present the bank has small number of asset/loan customers. The bank wants to increase 
their income by increasing the customer base of “asset customers”.  
Last year the bank ran a campaign where they successfully converted 9% of the existing 
“liability customers” to “asset customers”.  
This has encouraged the bank to have a better targeted marketing campaign to increase 
the success ratio with minimum budget. 


## APPROACH USED 
-> Performed preliminary data analysis (EDA) and visualization tools (scatter chart, bar chart, etc) to understand the profile of customers having savings account, who took 
personal loan in the last marketing campaign VS customers who didn’t take it up.  
-> Compared the effect of various significant attributes with personal loan using pivot 
tables. 
-> Using EDA identify profile of customers whom bank can target for selling personal loans. 
You have been provided with a dataset of 5000 customers. The data include customer 
demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank 
(mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan 
campaign (Personal Loan).
