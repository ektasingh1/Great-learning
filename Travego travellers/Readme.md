## Project Overview:-
You have to keep the record of the passengers and price to travel between two cities by bus,for types (Sitting and Sleeper).
The focus of this project is to learn to write different types SQL statements to insert and retrieve data from a database.

2	Sleeper	500	1100
3	Sleeper	600	1320
4	Sleeper	700	1540
5	Sleeper	1000	2200
6	Sleeper	1200	2640
7	Sleeper	1500	2700
8	Sitting	500	620
9	Sitting	600	744
10	Sitting	700	868
11	Sitting	1000	1240
12	Sitting	1200	1488
